## Introduction



## How to install/run it?
Download the file **"ZF Bone tools.ijm"** from the repository and drag it into the directory: 
⁨

Applications ▸ Fiji⁩ ▸ ⁨macros⁩ ▸ toolsets ▸ ZF Bone tools.ijm

Then open Fiji, click on the last bottom of the toolbar: ">>" icon ("More tools" menu) and click on ZF Bone tools.

Now ZB BONE toolbar will appear on the main Fiji toolbar.

*The same steps will work for ImageJ.*

###### OPERCULUM ASSAY ![](icons/Operculum_assay_logo.jpg) 




**Quick introduction**

The *operculum assay tool* allows the user to automatically measure the area of the head and the area of the operculum. It will then compute the ratio to normalize for inter-specimen variability.

This macro is based on the publication: Tarasco, M., Laizé, V., Cardeira, J., Cancela, M.L., Gavaia, P.J., 2017. The zebrafish operculum: a powerful system to assess osteogenic bioactivities of molecules with pharmacological and toxicological relevance. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part C 147, 45–52. 

**Imput data**

The macro needs an open image (RGB image) to start the process.
In case other type of images are opened, the macro will recognize it and stop the process. 

**Output data**

The macro will automatically create a folder (*"analized"*) in the same image directory which will contain the result table and a screenshot of the image analized showing the results and the ROI selected. This allows the user to confirm that all the  area selected are in fact the one wanted. 


**How to use it**

Simply drag/open an image in Fiji and press the corresponded icon. 
The user will be asked to first draw the region of interest (i.e. the fish head) and then a second region of interest (i.e. the operculum).
In case one ROI is missing the macro will stop and wait for it to proceed.

The macro needs an open image to start the process.
It will allert the user in case was open the wrong image
